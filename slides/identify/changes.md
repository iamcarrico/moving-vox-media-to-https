### Changes

* Content we controlled <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Third-party services <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Embedded content <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Ads <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->



Note:

So we broke down all of our content that was insecure into buckets that needed updating.

* Content we controlled— things that we can update on our own end.
* Third-party services— analytics, partners— everything that we require to run our business.
* Embedded content— all the content editorial adds in
* Advertising— those pesky ads that add in their own content.
