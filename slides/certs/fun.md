### Fun fact!

`*.voxmedia.com`

DOES NOT COVER

`vox.staging.voxmedia.com`

Note:

Wildcard certificates cannot cover more than one level deep, so if you're using a combination of subdomainsâ€” you will need multiple certificates.

Since our staging servers included multiple layers, we had to get a little more creative.
